### Description

Pull the pokeapi and parse out the json to get information on damage relations.

### What I Learned

* Learned how to use the Json and Open URI gems to pull down the hash and parse it.
* First time ever using an API, yay!
* Wanted to share this with a friend so figured out how to create a Docker image that will run this on startup.
